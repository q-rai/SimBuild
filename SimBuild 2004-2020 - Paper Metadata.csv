These areas share many similarities, and yet, not much study has been done regarding the possible conflicting issues between them. A research was conducted in order to reveal these conflicts, by comparing the influence on acoustical conditions with the influence on climatic conditions of several design parameters. The focus of the research was on the acoustical performance of sunshades. For this purpose, a computerized model, APS, was developed and used to create different geometries of climatically satisfying horizontal sunshades, and evaluate their influence on acoustical conditions inside a room. This paper presents the importance of developing such a model as a tool for architects and climatic designers for a better acoustical-oriented design of sunshades.",simbuild2004

This study presents a comparative analysis of three one-dimensional, optical slat-type blind models suitable for building load calculations. The influence of input parameters on the predicted solar transmittance is investigated. The models are also compared to experimental data. Furthermore, the effect of the blind on building thermal loads is investigated. The results indicate that there is a need for a comprehensive optical blind model that includes advantageous features from each of the three models. In addition, a general thermal fenestration model that predicts the thermal interaction of the fenestration system having the blind with the conditioned space is needed in order to utilize onedimensional blind models in thermal load and energy calculations.",simbuild2004

The analysis was used to demonstrate the system performance and energy savings to the owner, in order to facilitate the acceptance of the system and replacement of the owner's standard overhead mixing, plenum box air supply. The CFD analysis demonstrated that the proposed system would perform as intended, would meet the owner's temperature requirements, and would improve the design by optimizing supply temperature and volumetric flow rate. A life cycle cost analysis showed the possible economic benefits for the proposed displacement ventilation system compared to the owner's standard system. The proposed building site is situated near Dallas, Texas. Once built, the owner will monitor the store with displacement ventilation and compare its energy performance with a nearby store utilizing their standard, overhead plenum-box system. This comparison will be made public following the analysis period in a separate report by the owner.",simbuild2004

This is an attempt to produce more realistic models of UFAD systems. Both experimental and theoretical modeling are described in this paper. In the experiments, a plume and fountains represent a heat source and cooling diffusers, respectively. The experiments suggest how the entrainment rate of ambient fluid into the fountain at the interface changes with the local Richardson number. They show that for a fixed ventilation rate, as the source elevation is increased, the return temperature remains unchanged and the height of the cooler, lower zone increases. The effect of multiple cooling diffusers is to decrease the height and the temperature of the cooler zone for a fixed ventilation rate, and to cool both layers for a fixed under floor plenum pressure.",simbuild2004

We show that the geometry of the plenum causes the flow to exhibit two-dimensional dynamics and to develop flow patterns that are determined by the inlets of the underfloor into the plenum void. We describe laboratory experiments that simulate these flows and also show that the location and number of diffusers in the plenum has little effect on the underfloor flow. Depending on the location of the inlets to the plenum, the flow can exhibit complex vortex patterns and may be time dependent. The presence of these vortices produces different residence times of the air in the plenum. Consequently, the heat transfer through the flow from the room above can lead to significant spatial and temporal variation of the air entering the room through different diffusers.",simbuild2004

There is a belief among many clients and practitioners that such designs improve comfort and productivity, and organizations such as CIBSE recommend such schemes in preference to full air-conditioning. Importantly, both the tools and knowledge to support such designs can be subcontracted for practices without in-house capabilities. In North America, even in regions where natural ventilation has been used in the past, few people are in a position to quantify the performance of such designs and only recently have analysis facilities begun to be included in tools. Catch-22. Clients have had to go outside North America to source tools and professional skills.

The coupling of these two programs can provide a complementary and thus more accurate prediction of airflow in buildings with an acceptable computing cost. This paper reports the process to couple a multi-zone and a CFD program through pressure boundary conditions at room openings. The study developed a new algorithm to handle pressure boundary conditions in CFD. The algorithm allows the specification of a static or total pressure condition for a particular opening in CFD. It can automatically determine whether the pressure should be treated as total pressure (inflow) or static pressure (outflow) based on whether the airflow enters or leaves the space. To achieve a stable solution during the iterative calculation, special numerical relaxation methods have been used in the implementation of pressure boundary conditions. The validation and application studies show that the pressure boundary treatments and the coupling algorithm are sound.",simbuild2004

Many of the outdoor urban surfaces such as streets, sidewalks and building elements use low albedo materials that also have high thermal capacity. Field measurements indicate that it is not uncommon to have on a summer day surface Sol-air temperature of 150ºF (65ºC). The aggregation of such high surface temperatures is the prime cause of the urban heat island. Our understanding of this phenomenon has been hampered because the physics of radiant heat exchange are so complex it can only be modeled accurately at the urban scale by computer simulation. The paper illustrates the potential of a simulation program called RadTherm as a design tool to mitigate outdoor surface temperatures. The study models a typical urban streetscape in RadTherm to optimize the interaction between building materials, surface properties, adjacencies (view factors) and resultant surface temperatures. The performance of distinct parts of the urban streetscape are planned to demonstrate the possible application of the program for developing urban design guidelines to mitigate the urban heat island.",simbuild2004

USA",Variable Heat Recovery in Double Bundle Electric Chillers,,"In programs such as BLAST and DOE-2, the Double Bundle Electric Chiller model uses fixed input values for determining the recoverable heat component. The drawback of this approach is no dependence on system demands, plant, and cooling tower loads. Determining the availability or gradation (quality of heat) of the recoverable heat, is a subjective user input, and independent of the flow rates and temperatures. In a program like EnergyPlus, the plant and heat recovery equipment is now connected with loops having mass flow rates and temperatures, allowing for a more sophisticated simulation. Execution speed still restricts the chiller simulation to empirical models that give the total condenser heat as an output for the cooling tower and heat recovery loops. A new algorithm that bases the recoverable heat fraction on the flow rates and inlet temperatures has been developed. This algorithm uses relatively simple inputs to determine the fraction of the heat recovered and the heat rejected by the cooling tower. The variations in the mass flow rates and temperatures in the simulation are now used to obtain more realistic heat transfer rates of each component. This paper presents an analysis of the new algorithm for determining the heat recovery factor, and presents examples showing its performance and advantages of this model over the simple model.

In addition to its previously released IFCtoIDF utility that semiautomates the import of building geometry, the new IFC HVAC interface to EnergyPlus (released at the end of 2003) makes it possible to import and export most of the data that define HVAC equipment and systems in a building directly from and to other IFC compatible software tools. This reduces the manual input of other data needed for successful simulation with EnergyPlus to a minimum. The main purpose of this new interface is to enable import of HVAC equipment and systems definitions, generated by other IFC compatible software tools (such as HVAC systems design tools) and data bases, into EnergyPlus, and to write such definitions contained in EnergyPlus input files to the original IFC files from which building geometry was extracted for the particular EnergyPlus input. In addition, this interface sets an example for developers of other software tools how to import and/or export data other than building geometry from and/or into EnergyPlus.

Data from the Iowa Energy Center (IEC), which is typical of small commercial buildings, were used to train an inverse model that was then employed as a tool to evaluate the potential for peak load reduction through control of building thermal mass.

Model-free reinforcement learning control is investigated for the operation of electrically driven chilled water systems in heavy-mass commercial buildings. The reinforcement learning controller learns to precool the building at night before the onset of occupancy based on the feedback it receives from past control actions. The learning agent interacts with its environment by commanding the global zone temperature setpoints and extracts cues about the environment solely based on the reinforcement feedback it receives, which in this study is the monetary cost of each control action. No prediction or system model is required. Over time and by exploring the environment, the reinforcement learning controller establishes a statistical summary of plant operation, which is continuously updated as operation continues. The controller learns to account for the time-dependent cost of electricity, the availability of passive thermal storage inventory, and weather conditions. This study revealed that learning control is a feasible methodology to find a near-optimal setpoint profile for exploiting the passive building thermal storage capacity. The freedom from a building model makes it especially attractive in real-time control problems, and theoretically it can reach the ""true"" optimum eventually, no matter what building it is dealing with, if only the environment could be sampled for an infinite period of time. The analysis showed that the learning controller is affected by the dimension of the action and state space, the utility rate differentials between on- and off-peak, learning rate and several other factors. Moreover, learning speed is relatively low when dealing with problems with large state space and action space.",simbuild2004

It is intended to provide a user's perspective of CFD challenges and not a scientific report on cutting edge simulation techniques and algorithms. The combination of large dimensions with often non orthogonal geometry poses a unique challenge to CFD software. Models quickly become very large and require more memory than some operating systems and workstations can provide. In addition to these model size issues architectural models need to properly consider ambient weather conditions. Solar loading and the resulting buoyancy driven convection can completely change airflow patterns and comfort conditions in a building. Equally important is proper consideration of exterior wind pressure on building openings. Methods for determining these and other boundary conditions are discussed. Changing weather conditions throughout the year require CFD analysis for several days of the year. Some problems cannot be solved in steady-state mode and require a transient analysis. Economic and project time limitations in the real world demand smart problem simplifications.

The antifreeze mixture type and concentration has a number of implications for the design and performance of the system. These include the required ground loop heat exchanger length, the capacity and energy consumption of the heat pump, the circulating pump selection, pumping energy, and the first cost of the system. For example, the required ground loop heat exchanger length and first cost will decrease, due to lower permissible operating temperatures, with increasing antifreeze concentration in heating-dominated climates. On the other hand, the antifreeze also degrades the heat pump performance; operating costs can be expected to increase with increasing antifreeze concentration, and a larger capacity heat pump may be needed. The complex interaction between all of the design variables makes it difficult to choose an optimal design, and it is desirable to have a simulation and life cycle cost analysis that can be used to evaluate all of the variable interactions, to be used as the basis for an optimal design procedure.

The basic process is to take each building in the 1999 CBECS public use data files and create a baseline building energy model for it as if it were being built new in 2005 with code-minimum energy performance. The 1999 CBECS data form a statistical model of the commercial buildings sector by using a set of 5,430 buildings with weighting factors to indicate how many more such buildings are represented by each member. For each building, we used 1999 CBECS data on floor area, number of floors, census division, basic climatic design criteria, principal building activity, and number of employees. The expanded building descriptions needed for detailed energy modeling with EnergyPlus were generated by applying ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004 and augmenting with data from Huang and Franconi (1999), probabilistic assignments, and other assumptions. The technical potential of energy design measures, for the sector as a whole, were then evaluated by altering and rerunning the energy models, comparing perturbed results to each baseline, and then aggregating performance metrics. The primary benefit of the method is that the CBECS weighting factors provide a robust way of aggregating national results from simulations of individual buildings. However, it is also challenging because it requires considerable computing resources. The methodology is recommended for future analyses when the results must properly reflect the national implications and when only a limited number of scenarios need to be investigated.

For example, in summer, the building mass can be pre-cooled during non-peak hours in order to reduce the cooling load in the peak hours. As a result, the cooling load is shifted in time and the peak demand is reduced. The building mass can be cooled most effectively during unoccupied hours because it is possible to relax the comfort constraints. While the benefits of demand shift are certain, different thermal mass discharge strategies result in different cooling load reduction and savings. The goal of an optimized discharge strategy is to maximize the thermal mass discharge and minimize the possibility of rebounds before the shed period ends. A series of filed tests were carefully planned and conducted in two commercial buildings in Northern California to investigate the effects of various precooling and demand shed strategies. Field tests demonstrated the potential of cooling load reduction in peak hours and importance of discharge strategies to avoid rebounds. EnergyPlus simulation models were constructed and calibrated to investigate different kind of recovery strategies. The results indicate the value of pre-cooling in maximizing the electrical shed in the on-peak period. The results also indicate that the dynamics of the shed need to be managed in order to avoid discharging the thermal capacity of the building too quickly, resulting in high cooling load and electric demand before the end of the shed period. An exponential trajectory for the zone set-point during the discharge period yielded good results and is recommended for practical implementation.",simbuild2006

These utility programs attempt to influence decisions that significantly impact the energy performance of the designed building. To be effective for market transformation, these programs need to provide incentives for more energy-efficiency decisions that occur in the conceptual stages of design.

While it is well known that window shades affect heat gain and loss through windows and thus building energy loads, there is limited information on the actual magnitude and specific behavior of their effects on the building thermal and lighting loads. The objective of the described study is to generalize the magnitude of the impact from window shading control strategies on building thermal and lighting loads over a year by modeling a representative office building construction in indicative geographical locations as well as internal window shades representative of those that are commonly used. Two control algorithms are developed and evaluated
which are the ideal algorithm and implementable. The
basic principle of both of the algorithm is to maximize
heat gain and minimize heat loss when the building is
in heating condition, and performs the opposite when the
building is in cooling condition, subject to glare control.
The ideal algorithm is an optimized algorithm, however,
some of the information that is used in the ideal algorithm
is not available for a “real world” controller. Therefore,
a simplified implementable shading control algorithm is
also described, which will take sensor measurable outdoor
and indoor conditions as input, including outdoor dry bulb
temperature and transmitted solar radiation.
EnergyPlus (Version 3.1) is used to conduct the yearly

Despite the growing sophistication of building modelling tools, errors can arise from the approximations that are made during model creation. This paper addresses model zoning, i.e., how the volume of a building is divided into regions where properties are assumed to be uniform. Zoning is important during the creation of a model because the accuracy of prediction from simulating a model reduces when dissimilar zones are lumped together. In this paper, a systematic approach to creating zoning approximations is introduced to investigate the effect of zoning on simulation accuracy. Applying the Koopman operator, an infinite-dimensional, linear operator that captures nonlinear, finite-dimensional dynamics without linearization, a detailed building model is studied. Using the Koopman operator, the temperature history of rooms produced by a building simulation can be decomposed into Koopman modes. These modes identify dynamically significant behavior which will form a basis for the creation of zoning approximations.

To test the feasibility of using artificial intelligence techniques in optimising the EoS, an application using artificial neural networks (ANN) is developed and discussed. A detailed case study is also presented and discussed.",simbuild2012

",Annual Coupled EnergyPlus and Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulation of Natural Ventilation,,"Can coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Building Energy Simulation (BES) be used to conduct annual simulation? This paper tries to investigate the feasibility of annual coupled simulation of CFD and BES. Energy modeling approaches have continued to advance to cater for emerging new design concepts towards “greener” solutions that optimize energy consumption in buildings while maintaining thermal comfort as well as healthy environment. Various efforts have been made to improve the fidelity of the thermal simulation in buildings such as to couple CFD with lumped nodal BES model. Research has shown that the coupled simulation improves simulation accuracy. However, due to the nature of CFD simulation, coupled simulation usually takes much longer computation time. For example, the annual simulation of natural ventilation, which has relatively fewer incidences of CFD simulation runs, would take up to 46 days. In addressing the issue, a coupled lumped heat transfer model (EnergyPlus) and CFD model (Fluent) was implemented, and 8 days of simulation was conducted. Delaunay Triangulation based interpolation model was built from the 8 days’ results, which can be used to predict the airflow rates for openings for an annual simulation. It is shown that the interpolation model is able to predict 35% of the natural ventilation deployable time annually, when natural ventilation is appropriate in the Philadelphia climate context. The interpolation model reduces the simulation time by 90%.

In this study, the discharge coefficient for pivoted windows is considered, using analytical and CFD modeling as well as comparison with previous data. The discharge coefficient parameterization currently used in EnergyPlus can lead to an underestimate of flow through pivoted windows by up to factor of 2. This parameterization for the discharge coefficient as a function of window angle and aspect ratio is modified, and Reynolds-averaged numerical simulations are used to validate this new formulation.

",Coupled EnergyPlus and Computational Fluid Dynamics Natural Ventilation Simulation,,"Energy modeling approaches have continued to advance to cater for emerging new design concepts towards“greener” solutions that optimize energy consumption in buildings while maintaining thermal comfort as well as healthy environment. Increasing attention is given to passive and mix-mode systems in building. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model has been widely adopted as effective tool for natural ventilation simulations. However, CFD become unstable for conjugate heat transfer model, which is the transient heat transfer between solid, e.g., walls, and fluid, e.g., air. Solid and fluid has different respond times. Typically walls respond in hours, and air responds in seconds, causing the system to become stiff. In addressing the issue, a coupled lumped heat transfer model (EnergyPlus) and CFD model (Fluent) was implemented, and 8 days of simulation was conducted. The airflow rates of openings from the airflow network module in EnergyPlus and airflow rates from CFD model were compared. Results show that airflow network model generally predict smaller airflow rates for the openings. Airflow network model generates better results for openings on the south and east facade and internal openings, with difference ranging from −100% to −200%.",simbuild2012

",A Framework for Generating Stochastic Meteorological Years for Risk-Conscious Design of Buildings,,"Current performance-based design of buildings is predominantly based on deterministic simulation, but it is being increasingly recognized that the analysis of uncertainty and risk is important for project success, especially in the design of ultra-low energy buildings. As they represent the boundary conditions in energy simulation, weather data significantly affect model outcomes, so the uncertainty of the meteorological conditions should be taken into account in a riskconscious design process. In the United States, Typical Meteorological Years are used extensively in the analysis of building energy performance, though they fail to account for any variation from typical weather conditions. This paper seeks to address this issue through the stochastic modeling of meteorological data as a Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) process with seasonal nonstationarity. We present a framework that characterizes the VAR process using historical meteorological data for any given location. Once defined, the VAR process is able to generate any number of Stochastic Meteorological Years (SMY) for use in simulation packages.

When it comes to designing a passive system based concept that involves natural ventilation, a major difficulty for design teams is to reliably predict indoor ventilation rates especially in buildings located in a dense urban context. This manuscript proposes a new concept to model ventilation rates and hourly annual indoor temperature distributions using a combination of outside CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) calculations and indoor airflow network calculations. In the first step, CFD calculations for eight cardinal wind directions are used to populate a custom database of pressure coefficients for each window in an urban scene. In the second step, hourly wind data and pressure coefficients method have been implemented in Rhinoceros in combination with Phoenics and EnergyPlus.

This is especially true with faceted and curvilinear building facades where the glazing is not necessarily vertical. Building codes and software often cannot handle these more unusual curtain wall constructions and dynamic geometries. Consideration of these aspects will become increasingly important as parametric forms become more common. Advances in technology have been improving the building design process. One of the important competencies of building professionals is controlling the tremendous amount of data and information that is now associated with buildings. Intelligent software programs allow architects to study design parameters in the design phase, and some of the programs can even suggest design solutions. The ability to use the appropriate software programs and integrate them with design intuition has become one of the most important criteria for a technology-savvy architect in the
burgeoning filed of computational design. This paper focuses on tilted glazing and the effect of its angular dependence on direct solar heat gain (DSHG). Spreadsheet calculations were conducted, and the results were linked to an algorithm developed in Grasshopper to demonstrate form refinement of faceted building facades with an emphasis on the angle-dependent DSHG of glazing. This tool can be used at the outset of design or later as one of the components of an energy simulation program where architects can fine tune their initial ideas for the massing of a building. It can help them determine a better tilt angle of glazing for the building and its overall geometry in a specific climate. ",simbuild2012

Many sophisticated building energy modelers already know this and regularly create various scripts to automate portions of their workflows; however, each practitioner must create custom solutions from scratch, which lead to new inefficiencies and potential errors. This paper describes the scripting platform of the OpenStudio tool suite (http://openstudio.nrel.gov) and demonstrates its use in several contexts. Two classes of scripts are described and demonstrated: measures and free-form scripts. Measures are small, single-purpose scripts that conform to a predefined interface. Because measures are fairly simple, they can be written or modified by inexperienced programmers. Because measures have a known interface, they can be shared among users and selected for use at several places in the OpenStudio tool chain. We demonstrate the use of measures in an interactive mode from the OpenStudio SketchUp plug-in and in a noninteractive mode from the OpenStudio application. More experienced users can design and write free-form scripts to automate their work. We demonstrate the advantages of conducting large-scale analysis using free-form scripts through a case study.

",A Systematic Approach to Hygrothermal Modeling and Compliance with Failure Criteria Using WUFI,,"Simulating the prediction of moisture movement and related risk within building envelopes has gained momentum with the increased use of thicker walls, new materials and assemblies. One such simulation software used widely across North America for hygrothermal analysis is WUFI 5.1. As with any other simulator, WUFI 5.1 requires a few basic inputs such as location, orientation, climate and construction. But hygrothermal modeling is not a clear-cut task. The interactions between the macro level inputs and the dependency on molecular make-up and characteristics of materials makes prediction of hygrothermal performance very volatile. This volatility could lead to under or over predicting moisture related risk in building elements. As a part of an ongoing research and monitoring project, the authors' team evaluated and intends to monitor several different configurations of wall assemblies in multiple climate and moisture zones to determine the accuracy of moisture modeling. The goal is to make recommendations to ensure durable, efficient assemblies. Based on this research, this paper presents a systematic approach to hygrothermal modeling with WUFI 5.1.

The results show that implementation of the seven operation and maintenance measures as part of a retro-commissioning process can yield an average of about 22% energy use reduction and 14% energy cost reduction. Additionally, widening zone temperature deadband, lowering VAV terminal minimum air flow set points and lighting upgrades are found to be the most effective retrofit measures.",simbuild2012

",Prioritizing Building System Energy Failure Modes Using Whole Building Energy Simulation,,"Building failure modes can be defined as the range of possible faults, mistuning, degradation and wear that can occur in building systems. They drive poor operational energy performance that can be achieved as compared to what was expected in design. If the more critical failure modes can be uncovered early in design, they can be mitigated through design changes or monitoring of associated characteristics on parameters such as temperatures, flow rates and pressures. To understand and prioritize failure modes, failures are characterized through mappings to whole building simulation input variables, and then random sampling methods are applied to simulate the building operating under combinations of different failure modes. Reduced order models are then fit to the resulting data to detemine which failure modes are more critical.

However, interior daylight simulation on urban scale is time consuming and might be affected by a variety of factors. There is the need for measurement on urban scale that can provide relatively efficient and precise estimation of interior daylight potential. A daylight performance indicator for urban analysis was proposed: facade Vertical Daylight Factor per unit floor area, which is calculated as areaweighted total facade Vertical Daylight Factor divided by total floor area. Numerical simulation was conducted across 20 generic forms and 4 different density scenarios. The results showed a strong and positive correlation between the proposed indicator and the reference indicator of interior daylight potential, i.e. area-weighted average horizontal Daylight Factor at work plane height. The utility of the proposed daylight performance indicator lies in its efficiency of simulation for urban scale of analysis and, therefore, the impacts of geometry, spatial arrangement and envelope material properties of urban built forms on interior daylight potential can be evaluated efficiently in the early planning stage.

However, such design tools are not readily available to evaluate earth-air heat exchangers (EAHEs), also known as earth-tubes. Furthermore, even though many researchers have developed sophisticated equations to analyze EAHEs, they cannot be easily recast into design equations and must be used by trial-and-error. This paper describes a set of simplified analysis and design equations to support early-stage EAHE design and which are suitable for implementation in a spreadsheet. The equations we have developed allow the designer to quickly determine the length of tubing required for a desired level of heat transfer effectiveness; estimate the pressure drop across the system and required fan power; and estimate the mean monthly temperature of air exiting the tube.",simbuild2012

Concurrently, sustainable design is a rapidly growing segment of the building industry. One of the biggest challenges for the designers of sustainable buildings is achieving energy efficient designs utilizing parametric and/or creative configurations.
It is often difficult to accurately predict the energy performance of buildings that incorporate complex geometry in architectural design. The main reason behind this is that most simulation programs are designed for box-shaped buildings. Even building codes or standards, such as ASHRAE 90.1, do not account for issues regarding complex geometry. (Ko, 2012) Therefore in some cases, there are no feasible ways of considering the code or energy simulation.
This paper addresses the complex geometry issue in two parts: 1) a brief review of the current energy codes and standards in regards to angular dependence of SHGC for glazing property requirements and 2) a comparison of several building energy simulation programs in modelling of complex façades. In the first half, the limitation of energy codes and standards such as ASHRAE 90.1 were discussed. In the second half, several building simulation programs (Ecotect, eQUEST, IES-VE, DesignBuilder and EnergyPro) were investigated to check how the programs reflect the subject discussed in the first half, (i.e. if inclination of glazing had been properly accounted for). In the review, two issues were considered: if the program itself either imports or calculates the SHGC at different angles of incidence for each glazing system, and if the complex façade geometry can be modelled accurately in the software programs. At the end, a case study with glass dome was simulated in different programs and the results were compared.",simbuild2014

Although significant efforts have been made in the development of formats for the exchange of geometry and weather data inputs for simulation, or full building energy models (gbXML, IFC), limited attention has been paid to the documentation and exchange of model inputs for building properties, such as material definitions or load profiles. The lack of a widely accepted file format for their comprehensive management becomes especially problematic in the case of rapid energy model generation during early schematic or urban design explorations, because it reduces the time available for design iterations and increases the risk of errors.
Supported by a survey of 150 BPS professionals about their current energy modeling workflows, this paper outlines a vision for a new energy modeling data framework based on the use of building properties (BP) templates as a standard input format through the design stages of a project.

With this in mind, one of the main goals is to optimise the operation of the existing HVAC systems while maintaining adequate indoor conditions in terms of comfort.

Pedestrian simulations can identify potential threats already in the design phase of a building and evaluate protective measures. The BIM model serves as a central structure, which is going to be optimized by simulations (cf. figure 1). The building design is validated by a pedestrian simulation against performance indicators like the overall evacuation time or densities inside congestions. In order to improve the corresponding performance of the building, the simulator can automatically optimize relevant features of the BIM model - like door openings and wave breakers. After a review by the architect or engineer, the changes can be directly transferred to the model. Pedestrian streams turned out to be a limiting factor for building safety, particularly regarding emergency evacuation and the capacity of critical elements like stairways, escalators and elevators.
In addition, the pedestrian model can utilize information of the BIM model during operation. For example, in case of a fire, the simulator imports the position of the fire detectors from the model, queries its state from the Building Management System, and in turn can calculate safe egress routes for the occupants.",simbuild2014

All energy uses in a building are part of the buildings energy balance and for example the heat gains from a higher use of household electricity should result in a lower use of heating given that the heating control systems work as intended. Different user characteristics will result in different heating demand in the same building, and in low energy buildings different user characteristics will have a relatively higher impact compared to a less energy efficient buildings. Household electricity and domestic hot water was measured during one year in 520 one bedroom apartments and 462 two bedroom apartments in Sweden. The average annual use of household electricity was 27.7 kWh/m² in one bedroom apartments and 29.1 kWh/m² in two bedroom apartments.

With hourly based schedules and local weather data to implement the anisotropic HDKR-Model, SEAC is rooted on a transient 4-capacitorsimplified energy model to determine the resulting thermal response and quantities for reactive building loads and temperatures. Using American and German green building codes and standards, this methodology is applied to improve accuracy and reduce the required time for energy analysis and audits. Modeled energy usage is benchmarked against manually input utility, energy rating scores and ASHRAE 90.1:2010, and is analyzed to suggest potential energy conservation measures and estimate associated costs and energy savings. This paper describes the design and calculation approach for creating the SEAC tool and the implementation of RAPMOD into the automatic process flow.",simbuild2016

Therefore, the supervisory control could be realized as a software-only retrofit to existing building management systems. Second, the proposed control acts as a supervisory management layer over existing control systems, rather than replacing them outright.

As building models become larger and simulation programs become more complex, simulation runtimes have become an issue, despite the overall improvements in computer speed.
One obvious way to reduce runtimes is to not run the simulation for an entire year, but for a subset of days extracted from the year. The trade-off for the quicker runtimes is of course a loss in accuracy. Previous efforts using this technique have simply taken a random sampling of the time series, such as doing the simulation for four arbitrary 15-day periods spaced equally from a ""typical year"" weather file.
This paper investigates using the same technique developed for selecting the most representative months making up a ""typical year"" weather files but applies it to select a 7-day time series, i.e., a “typical week”, that best matches the average long-term climatic conditions of a month.
If the source weather data is a “typical year” weather file, this technique analyzes the cumulative frequency distributions (CFD) of temperature, solar, wind, etc., for each of the 22-25 7-day series within that month, compare them to the CFD for the full month, and then selects the 7-day series with the smallest deviation in the CFDs as the “typical week”. The twelve “typical weeks” are then concatenated to produce a reduced “typical year” weather file containing only 12, rather than 52, weeks of data. For simplicity, the date stamp for each 7-day series can be set to the middle of each month. There are many simple ways to make such reduced weather files compatible with existing simulation program, although relatively modest changes would be needed to simplify their use and speed up runtimes by eliminating re-initialization between the “typical weeks”. Once that is done, runtimes should be reduced to 1/4 with little loss in accuracy compared to running the full year.
If the source weather data is the historical time-series, that should be used instead for selecting the “typical week”, which would greatly expand the number of candidate 7-day series by the number of years in the time-series. In such instances, it has been found that the reduced weather data set has an equal or at times even better fidelity than the “typical year” file to the average long-term climate conditions.",simbuild2016

Simplified energy modeling can allow more design teams and owners to leverage the power of energy modeling to inform their designs and lead to greater energy savings and a lower first cost because the technologies and design strategies can be thoroughly tested against models before the decisions are made. By starting a discussion on how to develop simplified energy modeling approaches and methods to validate results, we hope to increase innovation in energy modeling software while decreasing variation between modelers.
Simplified modeling is not yet widely accepted because it is unclear if the simplifications reduce the accuracy of the results. By starting an industry dialogue on a testing method for these modeling approaches, we hope to aid adoption of more streamlined tools when they can be shown to provide similar accuracy to more detailed tools. This paper discusses the need and advantages of a SEM approach and proposes a method to test simplified energy modeling programs against the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) prototype buildings. It builds on the testing procedure established for simulation engines by ASHRAE Standard 140. By comparing whole building and end use results from the accepted prototype buildings to any simplified modeling approach across multiple building types and climate zones we can determine if the simplifications create unwarranted error. We will present the SEM approach and results for a case study validation for a sample building types in 16 US climate zones from two such simplified energy modeling tools we can determine if simplifications create unacceptable and unwarranted error.

This paper analyzes the impact of different tolerances that has been widely used in energy modeling industry, inspects unmet load hour calculation methods of energy simulation tools and discusses the robustness of the 300 hour limitation of ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1. Finally, it explores a new framework to guide the unmet hour acceptance criteria and demonstrate energy saving possibilities through downsizing approach.",simbuild2018

",Scripting Frameworks for Enhancing EnergyPlus Modeling Productivity,,"Task automation is a great productivity enhancer in any workflow. In building energy modeling, scripting has emerged as a powerful tool for automating both standard tasks such as generating a code-minimum baseline model from a model of a proposed or actual building and for workflow customization.

Modelkit is an embedded Ruby library that allows modelers to create parameterized templates that instantiate different specific EnergyPlus input files depending on parameter values. OpenStudio Measures provide programmatic access to the OpenStudio object model; that model is translated into an EnergyPlus input file. CBECC uses a custom scripting/rule engine that operates on the Standards Data Dictionary (SDD) building model schema; OpenStudio is used to translate SDD files to EnergyPlus input files.

Due to recent rapid development in the commercial sector, the electricity consumption has increased in an average by more than 70% primarily due to high plug loads, hence increasing the cooling energy demand. In line with the key EU directives targeting CO2 emission reduction, current regulations have stringent insulation requirements for the building envelope. The current study focuses on evaluating the effect of the regulations on high internal load (plug loads, occupancy etc.) buildings in central Europe. The annual primary heating and cooling energy demands have been calculated by dynamic thermal simulation software for standard and future IPCC (2030) A1B climatic scenarios for three buildings in Budapest, Hungary that meet EU's directives, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD). The results show that by implementing the current local regulations (TNM recast) with more stringent requirements than the previous code (7/2006 TNM) leads to increased primary cooling energy up to 10% in all the simulated cases. This increase is even more profound with IPCC (2030) A1B weather scenario.

Bhadra, Vaidya, & Sarraf (2017) have shown that for 60 cities in India, minimum thermal autonomy calculated by using the thermostat set point as the benchmark, is at 12% for night cooling, 75% for evaporative cooling, 28% for ground cooling and 32% for radiant cooling. This paper takes that approach further and quantifies the reduction in cooling energy due to three passive strategies, using the CIBSE method with Cooling Degree Days (CDD) for 60 Indian cities.
Three passive strategies: night ventilation, comfort ventilation and evaporative cooling are considered for mixed mode institutional buildings in India. Using the CIBSE TM41, the Balance Point Temperature (BPT) for two different versions of Indian buildings is established; 1) buildings complying with the latest energy code i.e. Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC 2017), and 2) business-as-usual buildings in India. Using these BPT values and the latest TMY files, the residual CDD for the three passive design strategies and the CDD for buildings without passive strategies are calculated. Cooling energy consumption is then calculated for all the cases for the 60 cities.
The study provides two versions of BPT for Indian buildings, which are more realistic that those published in the past. The results indicate the cooling energy reduction possible due to three common passive design strategies.

The daylightophil envelope protects the building from sunlight by preventing the solar radiation entrancement, then causes decreasing building loads in the operational phase. At the essence, this paper focuses on building Operational Energy (OE) and Embodied Energy (EE), when external shading systems are applied as an energy efficient element in the building. To evaluate external shading system role in building thermal needs and environmental impact, Life Cycle Energy Assessment (LCEA) method is employed. LCEA is influenced by OE and EE. EE is total energy consumed in the life cycle stages of building, whereas operational energy is the energy required to operate the building in the process such as space conditioning, lighting and operating other building appliances. LCEA notion not only illustrates the usefulness of the building's life cycle but also facilitates decision-making on the energy efficiency of the system to benefit the optimization. The comparison baseline for simulation is the shading sytems effect on the consumued energy by building in Tehran. The results prove that building in the target climate with an external shading meets the lower OE over the building life cycle about 4%, and accordingly lower-polluting because of the lower consumed energy – especially cooling loads – comparison with the absence of shading system, but the shading material causes some environmental impact too.",simbuild2018

The building energy consumption, notably the energy used for airconditioning is closely related to outdoor climate. The Solar Radiation, Drybulb Temperature and Relative Humidity are the important climatic parameters which affect building's thermal and visual conditions. The energy codes development analyses and evaluation of new technologies with respect to energy savings and financial viability have been carried out for selected cities that are supposed to represent any particular climate zone. There is a significant change in thermal loads in different cities of a climate zone. Selection of a representative city for a climatic zone is important because it needs to reflect average climatic conditions for a particular climate zone accurately. This study presents a new method that has been developed for the selection of a representative city in any climate zone, using the principle of Euclidean distance approach having a dry-bulb temperature, wet bulb temperature and solar radiation as three axes. The city having minimum Euclidean distance with respect to remaining cities of the same climatic zone is proposed to be taken as a representative city.

This technique allows for fluid flows and pressures to be simulated without resorting to a full CFD analysis.

Most solvers for building simulation flow networks are based on some derivative of Newton's method. These solvers can show fast convergence when good initial guesses are provided but can be slow or divergent otherwise, especially in large networks. This paper introduces a new fictitious transient term to the nodal conservation of mass equations which allows for the equations to be decoupled and solved using explicit methods. This effectively removes the need for a multivariable nonlinear solver when simulating flow networks. The effects of a single model input parameter on stability and accuracy was investigated.

This is reflected in government strategy and funding toward a low carbon, smart, local energy system. Such studies would provide detailed advice on technical and economic feasibility and assist in developing a technical specification. Local energy system projects vary wildly in scale, from a single building to districts and the whole city. However, the building stock in a city is distributed over the territory, and some of the building types are present only at specific sites. Therefore, domestic energy and carbon models need tools to determine their spatial dimension and these may be provided by spatial components. This paper describes the development of a spatial framework for annual energy consumption, CO2 emissions and fuel poverty estimation from individual dwellings to neighbourhoods up to districts and the whole city.

In this paper, we present a framework to automatically identify the optimal location of rooftop PV panels on residential buildings. Our framework integrates multiple workflows, including energy and environmental simulation, parametric modeling, and optimization to identify the ideal location of PV panels to balance the demand and supply of residential buildings. These workflows are linked using the Grasshopper plug-in for Rhinoceros CAD software. The framework includes two different workflows, each satisfying a target for optimal PV placement: (a) maximizing PV panel efficiency, where users aim to maximize energy generation, and (b) minimizing operational energy cost, where best"" panels are selected considering utility rates for operational energy cost. Our framework is demonstrated in a residential community in Fort Collins, Colorado, to generate the optimal PV placement for each of the two aforementioned targets. Results from the two workflows are compared to illustrate the effect of PV location and orientation on solar energy production efficiency and operational energy cost.

An emerging body of research has identified these two metrics as significant indicators of energy efficient building performance. However, there remains a need to achieve consensus about how to coherently model these metrics during the early stages of design to better inform decision making. This paper proposes a framework to establish a common set of conventions, protocols and benchmarks for TA and PH metrics. First, it attempts to address the comfort and habitability indoor temperature thresholds that presently vary considerably in the literature and then to define both comfort thresholds appropriate for the analysis of passive measures in naturally ventilated buildings, and habitability thresholds under extreme conditions of high temperatures and humidity. Second, a consistent methodology for compiling weather data that reflect the impacts of climate change on extreme weather events is advanced. Third, modeling assumptions address the most vulnerable occupants in terms of their age and state of health, but also reconcile, in the case of multi-unit residential housing, the correlation between individual suite behaviour and whole-building performance so that the 'weakest links in the chain' deliver acceptable levels of thermal resilience. This paper also advocates for the inclusion of minimum levels of thermal resilience in future codes and standards to futureproof buildings.",simbuild2020

However, two bigest hurdles that prevent wide adoption of simplified modeling is the continutity and consistency issues between the early simplified models and the destined detailed models.

Daylight is typically not sufficient in these dwellings, as many units are small and single-aspect, with a deep floorplate and a balcony that shades the living spaces within and below. There are no established metrics or methods specifically aimed to aid in daylighting design for MURB. There is a need for increased understanding of daylighting in these buildings, and better methods and metrics to simulate daylight performance. New early stage climate-based daylighting modeling (CBDM) tools such as DIVA allow designers to predict daylight performance in buildings. These tools were developed with offices in mind, and have underlying assumptions such as work hours and occupancy during daylight, and a focus on productivity and minimum sufficient lighting for a task, that make them difficult to adopt for MURB.

Urban-scale analysis at this level of complexity often requires linking multiple emerging tools, rather than using a single tool, to adequately evaluate a variety of possible fields in urban environmental design. To achieve this, flexible platforms are needed to support multiple input formats (e.g., geometric and non-geometric building properties), enabling the mapping of such inputs to underlying simulation engines.

Numerous studies have implemented CO2-based DCV strategies for single zone Heating, Ventilation, and Airconditioning (HVAC) systems and multiple zone single-path Variable Air Volume (VAV) systems. However, DCV for multiple zone VAV systems with multiple recirculation paths is still untapped, including VAV systems with Series Fan-Powered Terminal Units (SFPTUs), Parallel Fan-Powered Terminal Units (PFPTUs), and Dual-Fan Dual-Duct (DFDD) system.

All the ventilation related control strategies satisfy ASHRAE standard 62.1 and other control sequences (e.g., local terminal unit controls) follow ASHRAE Guideline 36. DCV controls for three systems are implemented in Energyplus Energy Management System (EMS) module. New EnergyPlus actuators (e.g., zone minimum airflow) are added and a customized Energyplus is built to achieve the DCV control for each system. An office building is used as a case study to demonstrate the benefits from DCV strategies for multiple recirculation path systems in four different climates. For each system, two baselines for ventilation requirements (ASHRAE 62.1, California Title 24) are considered. The simulation results show that the DCV control logic could lead to 7-14%, 7-21%, 1-8% HVAC source energy savings for SFPTU, PFPTU, and DFDDTU systems respectively compared with the baseline ASHRAE 62.1 approach.

There are two configurations of the solid desiccant dehumidification system: desiccant wheels and desiccant coated heat exchangers (DCHE). Previous studies focused on the effect on dehumidification performance using different desiccant materials on the DCHE. However, the performance of dehumidification remains to be quantified because the geometrical and operational conditions of the DCHE also play an essential role in its dehumidification performance for a given desiccant material. Therefore, it is important to evaluate their effects on dehumidification performance through modeling to assist in component design and operation.

The model uses an implicit finite difference scheme to solve the governing equations, which represent the heat and mass balances in the control volume. The heat balances are evaluated for the airflow, water flow, tube, desiccant, and fin. The fin and solid desiccant are considered as having the same temperature. The mass balances are evaluated for the airside and the solid desiccant material.

Still, the outlet temperature showed more difference, with results outside the 15% deviation range. The model temperature results also showed a faster change than the experiment.

However, as code requirements become more stringent and energy efficiency targets more ambitious, modelers are struggling to keep up with tightening project timelines and increasingly complex design features. New technologies can require significant time for research, prototyping, and development of modeling solutions. Additionally, code compliance documentation can be time-consuming but provides limited value to the design process. The time spent on these tasks can end up being a significant component of project soft costs, thus diminishing the business case for BEM. Previous attempts have been made to simplify the process of analyzing groups of Energy Saving Measures (ESMs), but they are limited in customizability and programmability for complex measures. This paper proposes an automation workflow capable of optimizing large scale parametrics to inform building design and generating code and beyond-code compliance documentation. The authors developed a Python module to share and automate numerous repeatable BEM tasks using predefined data models for simulation data exchange using the EnergyPlus engine. The combined use of a programming interface with EnergyPlus allows for the repeatable deployment of complex design measures and custom control sequences that have historically been significant pain-points for BEM practitioners. The Python module can also generate reporting documentation for code and beyond code compliance. A case study demonstrates how using this automation workflow allows design teams to maximize value to their clients and improve the overall value proposition for BEM.",simbuild2020

The model was calibrated with the amount of measured pressure and temperature at the building level. Model results provide insight into the likely behavior of the steam distribution system under different conditions. For example, changing the steam velocity at the zone-level from 10 m/s to 30 m/s results in a 7-fold increase in the pressure drop between the furthest node of the SDN and the building level. Moreover, the estimated temperature loss between the first node and the furthest node of the SDN (node 22) is 14.5 °C.

This paper details the simulation approach used in evaluating strategies to accomplish the 90% stormwater management goal. Utilizing data and geometry exported from both GIS and Rhino 3D modeling software, the team developed a custom multi-parameter simulation tool which allowed us to test various stormwater management planning scenarios. The team was able to vary strategies at a feature, parcel or district scale and the results are presented as percentages and total volumes.

Converting the two largest residential energy end uses – space and water heating – to electricity using Air Source Heat Pumps (ASHP) is quickly becoming a preferred decarbonization pathway in many jurisdictions (Reyna et al.2022). This, in combination with the upcoming IRA funding for heat pumps, is driving many utilities to offer new or increased incentives for heat pumps through utility programs. However, the conventional utility method of calculating the electricity and fuel impacts of heat pumps is still reliant on using Technical Reference Manual (TRM) engineering algorithms that are often inaccurate and do not explicitly consider important building characteristics like insulation and air leakage conditions of the home. Building energy modeling is a potential solution to the problem but has historically not been utilized for existing residential stock modeling due to the lack of prototypical starting models and the subsequent large upfront effort for model creation. NREL’s ResStock tool changes all of this and provides a clear pathway for generating electrification measure impact estimates that are anchored in the building stock characteristics of a utility territory and calibrated on an aggregate scale to metered data (Wilson 2017).

This study examines the impact of changes in occupants’ lifestyles on energy consumption in a university research building, in light of emerging workplace trends. Occupants were interviewed to determine plug-load ownership and usage schedules, and preferred air conditioning setpoint temperature. Inefficient workspace allocation and computer usage were identified as prime causes of energy wastage in the building. Potential energy-saving lifestyle change scenarios were developed to address these inefficiencies, including use of localized co-working spaces, night-time usage of computers, and increasing air conditioning setpoint temperature. Nighttime computer usage reduced overall energy consumption by 4% and increasing setpoint temperature by up to 6%. Reallocation of office space into localized co-working spaces had the most consequential impact, achieving energy savings of 25%.

It is possible to maximize energy savings by developing near-optimal control sequences, which are dependent on several factors such as the load profile. To address these gaps, we first identify an advanced control sequence and three key control parameters for chiller plants with WSE. Next, optimizations are performed to minimize energy consumption for seven combinations of control parameters. A chiller plant with WSE system in a warm and marine climate is studied and two load profiles are considered. The system and controls are modeled using the Modelica Buildings library. The results show optimizing the selected control parameters can reduce energy consumption by up to 11% depending on the load profile. Specifically, optimizing the cooling tower efficiency threshold in the condenser water reset control can significantly reduce energy savings for the variable load profile by efficiently shifting the load from the cooling tower to the chiller. This paper provides practical guidance for developing near-optimal control sequences for chiller plant with WSE systems considering impacts such as the load profile.",simbuild2024

A new tool available for all practitioners was developed to help with this issue. This tool, named Copper, is a performance curve generator for building energy simulation that enables modelers to generate full and part load efficiency metric-specific performance curves for HVAC equipment to be used in applications such as baseline modeling for building energy code compliance and simulations for early design analysis.

To make informed decisions about concentrating investments for Building Performance Standards building upgrades, accurate and equity-informed data sources are essential. There have been multiple new tools related to Energy Equity and Environmental Justice (EEEJ) and the resulting datasets need to be integrated into large building portfolios for quick access and increased scalability. Integrating the EEEJ data in a user-friendly format can help decision makers more quickly evaluate the impact and parse through the multitude of potentially significant metrics which have yet to become consensus-based.

In the US and Canada, many BPS ordinances primarily rely on ENERGY STAR® Portfolio Manager® (ESPM) for collecting building characteristics and energy-water consumption data. These datasets can then be imported into city-specific building tracking tools like the Stand-ard Energy Efficiency Data Platform (SEED). Crucially, BPS decision makers require an efficient means of identifying buildings in prioritized communities to allocate support resources effectively. This process needs to integrate seamlessly into existing jurisdiction-al toolsets for optimal utility. This paper will demonstrate for the case of Washington D.C.’s (the District) data a workflow that provides actionable data for building upgrade investment prioritization in disadvantaged communities.

Therefore, understanding building performance under various future weather conditions and disrupt events is crucial. From this perspective, we developed a data generator tool for power outage events and future typical weather files, which provides both raw and synthetic data for researchers. They can download ready-to-use data with a single click by simply inputting the city name, time span, and CO2 emission scenarios. In addition, we conducted an EnergyPlus case study to compare energy consumption differences and building performance under power outages and future weather files. The results indicate that in an extreme warm weather condition under RCP8.5, ambient air temperature could increase by up to 7°C, which doubled the cooling demand. While the 50th and 90th percentile of history power outage is 5.5 hours and 72 hours respectively and can be used as reference for resilience-based design. The study also identified extreme weather as the dominant factor in power outage events, potentially causing up to 60% uncertainty in energy system management.

We found that Linear Regression performs best when the dataset is smaller than 1000 while Random Forest performs best as the training dataset increases above 1000.

With the advent of architectural geometry and digital fabrication, floor elements can be designed and fabricated with greater exposed surface area under the constraint of the same material volume, thus maintaining the same embodied carbon footprint, but increasing its thermal performance potential. This study examines the impact of increasing exposed surface area of ITM through geometric modulation while keeping the material volume constant to reduce the building’s embodied carbon.

This study explores the hygrothermal performance of 3D concrete printed wall assemblies, focusing on moisture accumulation, frost damage, mold growth, and corrosion risks. Employing the WUFI 2D simulation tool, we compare various insulation materials, concrete types, and wall designs to identify the most effective wall assemblies for 3D concrete printing. The findings indicate that cellulose insulation, due to its higher moisture content, is less suitable for 3D concrete printed walls, posing a higher risk of frost damage. Conversely, insulation materials with higher density and vapor resistance demonstrate better hygrothermal performance. The wall assembly with a layer of concrete bead connecting the interior and the exterior concrete layers leads to higher water content. Moreover, varying levels of vapor resistance in different concrete types affect the overall drying capability. Despite high relative humidity levels, no visible mold growth is predicted in the simulated assemblies, suggesting adequate mold resistance in the wall assemblies.",simbuild2024

The escalating complexity of DES necessitates adaptive, synergistic, and hierarchical control of heterogeneous systems to achieve common energy and cost conservation goals. Prior research highlights several challenges of model-based control techniques for DES, such as limited access to computational tools, prolonged durations to digital twin development, and the complexities associated with control design. In contrast, model-free control methodologies appear as a viable alternative. As a response, our study explores a reinforcement learning-based (RL) supervisory control to minimize the operational costs in a university campus DES. To enhance overall system efficiency, we utilize resource flexibility to improve DES operations by responding to fluctuations in utility prices. In this paper, we demonstrate the toolchain, and virtual testbed development, engineer a suitable RL reward, along with the learning from challenges. From the case study, the RL agent showcases a significant 32% net operational cost savings and a 13% peak demand reduction compared to the conventional thermal load following control. This research signifies the potential of RL-based control systems in optimizing the performance of complex DES and multi-energy systems involving several control points.

However, most studies examined this issue from a grid-operator perspective, while largely overlooking the end-user perspectives on thermal comfort and focusing on demand reduction, optimization strategy, and energy saving. This study addresses this gap by employing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to assess thermal comfort under global temperature adjustments in a demand response context. Two representative building ventilation strategies—mixing and displacement—and three levels of internal load intensity (low, medium, and high) are examined for a simulated small office environment based on the Department of Energy (DOE) reference building. Thermal comfort is evaluated using Predicted Mean Votes (PMV), draft risk, vertical temperature difference during both response and recovery periods. Results reveal that displacement ventilation enables faster temperature adjustments in the ASHRAE breathing zone across varying levels of internal load, as compared to mixing ventilation. Specifically, the rate of temperature change was 31% to 54% faster during the response period and 32% to 41% faster during the recovery. Furthermore, PMVs were found to decrease more swiftly under displacement ventilation as internal loads increased, indicating higher potential for energy savings. However, the study also found that displacement ventilation is particularly vulnerable to changes in supply air temperature, leading to more fluctuations in draft risk and vertical temperature difference.",simbuild2024

Our proposed workflow uses the Wave Function Collapse algorithm to generate a diverse set of floor plans. It also includes post-COVID occupant presence models while incorporating adaptive comfort models. We conduct four sets of experiments using the workflow, and the simulated results suggest that multi-mode cooling strategies combining conventional air conditioning with NV can often significantly reduce energy use, about 18% to 40%, while introducing slight reductions in thermal comfort. This workflow could be beneficial for architects and other stakeholders to generate diverse design options and make decisions based on NV performance.",simbuild2024
